Overview
This project provides a face recognition-based attendance system to replace traditional manual methods. Using OpenCV, it captures and recognizes faces in real time, marking attendance automatically.

Features
Real-time face detection and recognition.
Attendance tracking with timestamps.
User-friendly interface for training new faces.
Stores attendance records in a CSV file.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries/Frameworks:
OpenCV
NumPy
Pandas
CSV
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or later
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
Pandas
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-attendance.git
cd face-recognition-attendance
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy pandas
(Optional) Set up a virtual environment for better package management:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
How It Works
Face Data Collection: Capture images of individuals and store them in a dataset.
Training: Use LBPH to train the model on the collected face data.
Face Recognition: Detect and recognize faces in real-time using the trained model.
Attendance Logging: Mark attendance and save records in a CSV file.
Usage
Run the Project:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Face Registration: Add new faces to the system by capturing images.
Attendance Tracking: Run the system to start recognizing faces and logging attendance.
Future Enhancements
Integrate with a database for better data management.
Add email notifications for attendance alerts.
Improve recognition accuracy with deep learning models.
